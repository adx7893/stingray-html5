# AutodeskÂ® Stingray HTML5 plugin

Render HTML5 views in Stingray. The engine plugin uses [CEF](https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef) to render HTML5 content to texture buffers. Once the texture buffers are generated, the render resource is assigned to the view's material `html5_texture` slot.

DISCLAIMER: This plugin is a **testbed** for [Stingray plugin extensibility framework](http://help.autodesk.com/view/Stingray/ENU/?guid=__sdk_help_introduction_html) and has no intention in being a good 2D UI framework for Stingray in its current form.
